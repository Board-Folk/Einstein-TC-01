# Einstein TC-01 TMS9929 adapter

![Built TC-01 TMS9929 adapter board in Green](https://github.com/Board-Folk/Einstein-TC-01/blob/main/images/TMSAdapterTC01v1_Small.png)

Adapter board to allow the use of a TMS9929 chip on the Tatung Einstein TC-01. The TMS9929 is easier to find than the original VDP, but requires a different type of RAM which needs fitting to the adapter.

Intended to work with 5V 1x16K DRAM chips, e.g. MB8118 or compatible, but can accept 4164 and 41256 RAM, which although is a waste as the majority of the RAM isn't used are more easily and cheaply obtained. This will not work with 4116 RAM as the board doesn't provide the correct voltages.

You do not need to fit the video RAM chips on the main board at I40 and I41 with this installed.
